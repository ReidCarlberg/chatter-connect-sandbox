NOTES:
* This file is for your convenience, it isn't part of the rails app.
* I post my info into a file like this called "creds_ignore.txt", which I also add to ".gitignore".  Then I copy and paste these lines into a terminal.
* Best practice is to avoid committing your OAuth2 details to a repo, so you set them as environmental variables instead.
* This works on a Mac, may require adjustment for other OS
* Here's a nice article on Config Vars over at Heroku: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars
* If you are using Omniauth.rb (and why wouldn't you?), the URI below should work.
